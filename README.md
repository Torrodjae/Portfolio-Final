# Torrodjae Somerville — Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website created for my CTEC Final Project. It highlights who I am, my skills, my experience, the major project I completed this semester, and includes my updated resume. The site also has a working chatbot and a QR code that links directly to the live page.

## What This Project Is  
This portfolio was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal was to create a clean, simple site that loads fast, works on both desktop and mobile, and presents my work professionally. Everything on the page—my sections, the chatbot, the resume, the QR code, and the project link—is organized so it’s easy to navigate and understand.

# How to Navigate the Site  

### **Home**  
A short intro and welcome section.

### **About**  
My skills, experience, and educational background.

### **Project**  
Summary of my CTEC 426 Data-Driven Used Car Pricing project with a link to the full GitHub repo.

### **Resume**  
A button that opens and downloads my resume (the PDF includes my QR code too).

### **Contact**  
Simple layout where a future backend could be added.

### **Chatbot**  
A chat button at the bottom-right that opens a small window where you can ask questions about:
- My skills  
- My experience  
- My availability  
- My project  

It understands full questions like “What are his skills?” and even handles small typos.

# How the Chatbot Works  
The chatbot is built completely in JavaScript. It doesn’t use any outside services or AI—it’s just logic I wrote myself. Here’s how it works:

- I created a small “knowledge base” inside the script with my skills, experience, project, and availability.
- When someone types a message, the chatbot reads it, lowers the text, and looks for certain keywords.
- It can understand different question styles (“skills?”, “what skills does he have?”, “tell me his skills”) and still give the right answer.
- It also does basic letter matching, so that it can handle simple typos.
- Everything runs on the client side so the chatbot responds instantly.
